## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

## Project Structure

This Flutter project follows a **Feature-First** approach combined with the **MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture** to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Below is the directory structure:

```
project_root/
â”‚â”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”‚   
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ core/			# Contains global utilities, constants, and shared services
â”‚   â”‚   
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ data/			# Handles data sources (APIs, local storage, etc.)
â”‚   â”‚   
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ features/		# Organizes code by feature
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ feature_name/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ controller/	# Business logic and state management
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ model/		   # Data structures and domain models
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ view/		   # UI components and widgets
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚       â”‚â”€â”€ widgets/        # Reusable widgets specific to the feature
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚       â”‚â”€â”€ view.dart       # UI code of the specific feature
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ routes/      # Handles app navigation
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ main.dart    # Application entry point
â”‚
â”‚â”€â”€ assets/			# Contains images, fonts, and other static resources
â”‚â”€â”€ pubspec.yaml	# Dependencies and project metadata
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md		# Project documentation
```

Each feature within the `features/` directory is self-contained, following the MVC pattern to maintain a clean separation of concerns.
